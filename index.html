When I asked for







My name is Pris Roos. I’m an artist living and rocking in Amsterdam. I am inspired by animals, the female body, rhythm and patterns.

I work in graphite and copic fineliners. I am currently working on a collection of The Big Five. The five greatest animals of Africa. I’d like to give my viewers a different look of nature. Nature is changeable and there are different hidden stories behind and in the subjects.

My illustrations will also appear on a variety of covers for the label "Comport Records"

I'm always interested to work on new ideas and illustrations. Feel free to contact me.
